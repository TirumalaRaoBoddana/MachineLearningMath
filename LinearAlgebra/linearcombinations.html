            <h4>Linear Combinations: </h4>
            <p>
               In Linear Algebra a linear combination refers to the operation of combining a set of vectors by multiplying each vector by a scalar coefficient and summing the results. Mathematically,let v1,v2,v3,....,vn be vectors in a Vector space V,and let c1,c2,c3,...,cn be scalar coefficients Then, the linear combination of these vectors is given by:
               <br>c<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>+ c<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>+ c<sub>3</sub>v<sub>3</sub>+....+ c<sub>n</sub>v<sub>n</sub><br>
               For Example:<br>
               consider a vector space R<sup>2</sup> with vectors v1=[10,5] and v2=[-15,10] and a and b be the scalar coefficients of the linear combination of vectors v1 and v2 respectively

                </li>
               </ol>
               <h5>Description: </h5>
               <ol type="i">
                <li>When one scalar coefficient (e.g.,a) changes while the other (e.g.b) remains constant, the resulting linear combination forms a line. This is demonstrated by the Desmos graph linked in the first option.</li>
                <li>Similarly, when the other scalar coefficient (e.g,b) changes while the first (e.g.a) remains constant, the resulting linear combination still forms a line. This is illustrated by the Desmos graph linked in the second option.</li>
                <li>If both scalar coefficients (both a and b) change, the resulting linear combination does not necessarily form a line. This is depicted in the Desmos graph linked in the third option.</li>
                <li>When both scalar coefficients (both a and b) are set to 0, the resulting linear combination is the zero vector. This is demonstrated by the Desmos graph linked in the fourth option.</li>
               </ol>
             </p>
             <h4>Linear Span: </h4>
             <p>
                In linear algebra, the linear span of a set of vectors refers to the set of all possible linear combinations that can be formed using those vectors. More formally, the linear span of a set of vectors {v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,v<sub>3</sub>,....,v<sub>n</sub>}
                in Vector Space V denoted by span(v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,v<sub>3</sub>,....,v<sub>n</sub>) is the set of all vectors that can be expressed as linear combinations of v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,v<sub>3</sub>,....,v<sub>n</sub> with arbitrary scalar coefficients.<br>
                Mathematically, the linear span of the vectors v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,v<sub>3</sub>,....,v<sub>n</sub> is defined as:
                <br>
                span(v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,v<sub>3</sub>,....,v<sub>n</sub>)={c<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>+c<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>+c<sub>3</sub>v<sub>3</sub>+....+c<sub>n</sub>v<sub>n</sub>}

             <h4>Linear Independence  and Linear Dependence</h4>
             <p>
                In linear algebra, linear independence is a concept that describes a set of vectors in a vector space. A set of vectors is said to be linearly independent if no vector in the set can be represented as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set.
                <br>Let v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,v<sub>3</sub>,....,v<sub>n</sub> be vectors in a vector space V.These vectors are said to be linearly independent if the only solution to the equation:
                <br>
                c<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>+c<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>+c<sub>3</sub>v<sub>3</sub>+....+c<sub>n</sub>v<sub>n</sub>=0<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                where c<sub>1</sub>,c<sub>2</sub>,c<sub>3</sub>,.....,c<sub>n</sub>.are scalars, is c<sub>1</sub>=c<sub>2</sub>=c<sub>3</sub>=...=c<sub>n</sub>=0<br>
                In other words, no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors. Each vector contributes a unique direction to the space spanned by the set of vectors.
                <br><a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/chmelo9wjj">Linear Independent Vectors</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                In linear algebra, linear dependence refers to the situation where one vector (or more) in a set of vectors can be represented as a linear combination of the others. In simpler terms, if you have a collection of vectors, and one of them can be written as a combination of the others (with nonzero coefficients), then that vector is said to be linearly dependent on the others.
                <br>Formally, let's say we have a set of vectors {v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,v<sub>3</sub>,....,v<sub>n</sub>} in a vector space V if there exist scalars c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>,...., c<sub>n</sub> not all zero,such that 
                <br>
                c<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>+c<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>+c<sub>3</sub>v<sub>3</sub>+....+c<sub>n</sub>v<sub>n</sub>=0
                where 0 denotes the zero vector, then the vectors are said to be linearly dependent.<br>
                On the other hand, if no such scalars other than all being zero can satisfy the equation above, then the vectors are said to be linearly independent. This implies that none of the vectors in the set can be written as a combination of the others.

                <h4>Span of Linearly Independent Vectors:</h4>
                <p>
                    The span of linearly independent vectors is the entire subspace they generate. In other words, any vector in the span can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of the linearly independent vectors.<br>
                    For example, if you have three linearly independent vectors in three-dimensional space, their span would form the entire three-dimensional space.Consider the two vectors v1=[1,0] and v2=[0,1] the span of the two vectors span the entire R<sup>2</sup> space.That means that we can represent the any vector in R<sup>2</sup> as the linear combination of the v1 and v2.

                <h4>
                    Span of Linearly Dependent Vectors:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The span of linearly dependent vectors is a subspace of the space they inhabit, with dimensionality equal to the number of linearly independent vectors in the set.<br>
                    For instance, if you have three vectors in three-dimensional space, but only two of them are linearly independent, their span will form a plane (a two-dimensional subspace) within the three-dimensional space. The third vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the other two, but it does not add any new dimension to the span.

            </p>
            <h4>Basis of Vector space: </h4>
            <p>In linear algebra, a basis of a vector space is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span the entire vector space.In other words, a basis provides a minimal set of vectors that can represent any vector in the vector space without redundancy.
            <br>
            Consider an example of R<sup>3</sup> space set of vectors v={[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]} are said to be basis of R<sup>3</sup>space because
            <br>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    The vectors are linearly independent because no vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the vectors space R<sup>3</sup> because any vector (a,b,c) in R<sup>3</sup> can be expressed as the linear combination of the vectors a(1,0,0)+b(0,1,0)+c(0,0,1)
                </li>
            </ol>
